            <h3>People the world over have many things in common, but there is one thing that has connected us from culture to culture and generation to generation and that is food.</h3>
            <p>Food plays a vital role in many parts of our lives including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>birthdays</b> - many of us put heavy emphasis on birthdays, be it a new born baby or an octogenarian to everyone in between and beyond, and it is always celebrated with food in the form of banquets or get-together dinners. In some cultures,
                    eating noodles on your birthday expresses longevity and prosperity and in others, eating an egg dyed in red food colouring symbolizes good fortune. Last but not least, the obligatory birthday cake! Everyone recognizes the significance
                    of a birthday cake.</li>
                <li><b>weddings</b> - In some cultures it's customary to have food banquets that last for days where the local village is invited to enjoy the celebrations. Some of the most extravagant foods can be witnessed at these awesome events.</li>
                <li><b>just about any occasion that calls for celebrations</b> - There's always something we can celebrate and it will almost always involve food in the form of cooking at home, eating out at a restaurant or ordering a takeaway to celebrate.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Through food, we express our love for the people significant to us. We eat when we are happy or sad. Some foods remind us of our childhood, good times with friends, our first love! It is literally in every corner of our lives and contributes
                to our experiences in ways we don't realise.</p>

            <h3>Understanding cultures through food</h3>

                some cultures express their respect to older generations, as nobody starts eating until the older generations are at the table. </p>
            <p>For those of us unable to travel, we can experience food via the comfort of our home and laptop with countless YouTubers who travel the world and introduce us to the global food and culture scene such as <a id="tribute-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/MarkWiens"
